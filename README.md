CTF Notes Repository

Welcome to my CTF Notes repository! This is a collection of my personal notes, write-ups, and resources gathered over three years of solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and machines on platforms like Hack The Box (HTB). The repository is organized to help me (and hopefully others) quickly reference techniques, tools, and methodologies used in various CTF challenges.
